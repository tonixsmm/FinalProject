## CPSC 222 Final Project


A Data Science project on sleep data and Netflix viewing activity.


This project consists of three parts:
* `healthdata_preprocessing.py `
* `utils.py`
* `ProjectNotebook.ipynb`
 
### What does the project does?


This project includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, statistical analysis, and DecisionTreeClassifier and KNeighborsClassifier machine learning implementation.
 
### Why is the project useful?


This project might be helpful for anyone interested in investigating about effects of a movie/series on the viewer. The scope of this project can be extended more to find if watching a movie/series can affect one's emotional well-being, as sleeping significantly correlates to that topic. 
 
### How to get started with this project?


Since the data size exceeds GitHub's capacity to upload, I have created a link to a Google Drive folder. Please download the file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x4rOMd9ZnXToDBX9p2wgPjvPL3djUcyz/view?usp=sharing) and move it to the same directory of the project.


Then, run `healthdata_preprocessing.py` first for it to return a CSV file.


Finally, run `ProjectNotebook.ipynb`.
